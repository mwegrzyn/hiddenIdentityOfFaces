### Requirements

Data analysis was performed with Python 2.7 [www.python.org](http://www.python.org) using mainly numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn and jupyter.


To run all the scipts, you can create a virtual environment, by first installing virtualenv


```shell
pip install virtualenv
```
Then you can create a virtual environment in the folder into which you cloned this repository

```shell
virtualenv venv
```

and then install all modules using pip and the requirements file provided in this repository


```shell
venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The main experiments were written and rendered with [PsychoPy](http://psychopy.org).
